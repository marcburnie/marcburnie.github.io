                    <h2>May 7th, 2020</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've officially been accepted into App Academy, Full Stack Academy, and Codesmith. After three
                        weeks of learning about each program, I can easily put Codesmith as my top preference. They
                        place a higher importance on soft skills rather than technical know-how. Even so, their entrance
                        requirements have also been the most technically challenging. They have an active online
                        community which I've enjoyed participating in, and engaging lectures with great instructors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll say in general though, that I initially viewed software boot camps with a lot of
                        skepticism. Now I see boot camps as being a disruptive to the college/univeristy educational
                        model. Having spent 6 years of my life earning my degrees and spending a small fortune on
                        tuition, I've probably only used 1/10th of what I learned in university at my job. Everything I
                        have learned during the boot camp application process is very relevant to what I want to do and
                        the quality of the teaching and materials are comparable to the best courses I took in
                        university. I think I would have been happy with any of the programs, but I am releived that I
                        was accepted into Codesmith.
                         <!-- Their next cohort doesn't start for another two months, so I've
                        enrolled in their <a href="https://www.codesmith.io/bootcamp-prep" title="CS Prep">CS Prep
                            program</a>, which is a 3 week course designed to help students get into a boot camp, but
                        I've found even their basic lectures have value in teaching technical and non-technical
                        communication. I also plan on taking several Udemy courses on web design and refining this
                        website. One thing is for certain, there is a lot to know when it comes to website design, so
                        there's no excuse not to stay busy. -->

                    <h1>JavaScript First Impressions</h1>
                    <h2>Apr 29th, 2020</h2>
                    <p>
                        Thankfully I had more time to learn JavaScript than Ruby. Out of all the programming languages I
                        have learned, it is the weirdest. It imitates many of the programming paradigms I've
                        encountered, but operates completely differently. The best comparison I can think of is JS is a
                        lot like a sleeper car; unassuming, powerful under-the-hood, and fragile if not used correctly.
                        With that said, I don't think I've ever had as much fun learning a language since I first
                        learned Visual Basic back in high school. I'm currently working through <a
                            href="https://csx.codesmith.io/home" title="CSX">CSX</a> which is Codesmith's free online
                        JavaScript course, which seems to be very comprehensive. I'm finding it much more difficult than
                        the Ruby coursework offered by App Academy; it's forcing me to look at other resources and
                        participate in Codesmith's online community to reach out for help. This may sound like a bad
                        thing, but this was my experience as a Mechanical Engineer as well. Engineering is difficult for
                        good reasons and I'm enjoying the challenge.
                    </p>
                    <!-- <p>
            On the boot camp application front, I recently learned I passed App Academy's technical interview as well as the non-technical interview I just had yesterday. This means I've been accepted into the program but I need to finish their HTML/CSS, Git, and boolean logic coursework before May 8th before I can enroll in the next cohort.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also applied to Codesmith's and Full Stack Academy's programs. I'm feeling comfortable enough with JS to complete Full Stack Academy's coding entrance exam tomorrow. In Codesmith's case this involved writing several essay style questions, which took a day in of itself. I also had my non-technical interview today with Codesmith, which is difficult to say how well it went since they appear to stress the non-technical aspects of Software Engineering the most.

                    <h1>Boot Camp Application First Impressions</h1>
                    <h2>Apr 25th, 2020</h2>
                    <p>
                        Well, I may be overreaching a bit with applying to 3 different boot camps. First of all, they
                        all have their own entrance requirements. App Academy requires technical assessments in Ruby,
                        while Full Stack Academy and Codesmith's assessments are in JavaScript. I knew nothing about
                        either language last week, but because the cut-off for App Academy's next cohort application was
                        yesterday, I know Ruby now! Luckily, I found Ruby very syntactically similar to Python, so it
                        wasn't too difficult.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really need to commend App Academy's application process. The first step involves completing a
                        reading and logical assessment similar to a standardized English test and an IQ test. Both are
                        timed, which I loathe, but I understand that it's probably the best way for App Academy to sort
                        out anyone who doesn't have the capability to program without actually testing programming
                        skills. I didn't feel I performed well myself, but luckily I did well enough to pass. Next, I
                        had to complete their Introduction to Ruby coursework and pass an online written programming
                        test in Ruby. The fact I was able to pick up Ruby in two days really speaks to the quality of
                        the course material and exercises. Lastly, I had a remote technical interview yesterday that
                        involved pair programming, which is also a new concept to me. Overall, I found the technical
                        assessments to be quite easy, though I feel that anyone without a background in programming
                        would struggle through even on a longer timeline. I should hear if I passed next week, but now
                        I'll need to focus on my applications for Codesmith and Full Stack Academy. Onto learning JS!

                    <h1>Software Boot Camps</h1>
                    <h2>April 19th, 2020</h2>
                    <p>The most common advice I've received about starting a career in Software Engineering is to enroll
                        in a software boot camp. Apparently, boot camps have an established track record of
                        employability and I've received a lot of anecdotal evidence to back this up. This is great news
                        for me considering that most of these programs are a few months in length as opposed to a few
                        years for a Software Engineering degree, so I've decided to go ahead and apply. The majority of
                        boot camp programs are focused on full stack web development; while I had not decided on what
                        area to specialize in, web development fits well with what I want to do and learn, and has
                        optimistic job growth. However, there are a plethora of boot camps, and even deciding on which
                        to apply to has been a challenge. I've narrowed the search down to three: App Academy, Full
                        Stack Academy, and Codesmith. I selected these boot camps because Full Stack and Codesmith had
                        the best employment outcomes on <a href="https://cirr.org/data"
                            title="January - June 2019 Graduate Outcomes">CIRR</a> last year and App Academy because it
                        showed up in both <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/best-coding-bootcamps"
                            title="The 48 Best Coding Bootcamps">Course Report's</a> and <a
                            href="https://www.switchup.org/rankings/best-coding-bootcamps"
                            title="2020 Best Coding Bootcamps">SwitchUp's</a> top 5, though it was not transparent on
                        employment outcomes on <a href="https://cirr.org/data"
                            title="January - June 2019 Graduate Outcomes">CIRR</a>. Codesmith's outcomes were by far the
                        most impressive: 92.1% employed in 180 days and $125K average starting salary in their NY
                        program in H1 2019, which seems to good to be true. I guess someone else thought so because they
                        were independently audited. First and foremost, my goal is employability as a Software Engineer,
                        so my plan is to use the application period as a way to learn more about each without commiting.
                        We'll see how it goes.</p>

                    <h1>Onward and Upward!</h1>
                    <h2>Apr 18th, 2020</h2>
                    <p>I was always told that the two best working days you'll have in your Schlumberger career is your
                        first and your last. I can tell you from personal experience that, while this may not the case
                        for everyone, the statement is true to me. Not to say I didn't enjoy my 10 years with the
                        company, but I've always regretted that I did not pursue a career in software and automation.
                        Now without the weight of responsibility that I had with Schlumberger, I am finally free to
                        pursue a career that I want for myself.</p>
                    <p>I cannot tell you how excited I am to get back into software. Software Engineering and Computer
                        Science were my dream careers as a teenager but, since I graduated around the dot-com boom and
                        bust, I was always told there were no jobs. Ironic hearing that in 2020. Turns out that "follow
                        your passion" is some good advice.</p>
                    <p>I'm expecting my transition to Software Engineering to be a challenging one since I'll need to
                        prove I can do the job without ever having held the title or the degree. The last time I was in
                        this situation I at least had my degrees and transcript to point to that demonstrated I had the
                        requisite knowledge, but even then it didn't prove I could do the job. The advantage I have
                        becoming a Software Engineer is that I can readily demonstrate what I know and what I can do -
                        by building a website. This is why this site exists and, possibly, why you are here; to assess
                        my competency. Regardless of the reason, I appreciate the time you have taken to explore my
                        website and learn more about me. Feel free to reach out to me - I'd love to get some feedback on
                        how to do things better or just knowing that someone actually visited a site I've put many hours
                        into. Regardless, I hope you enjoy your time here and thanks for visiting. Onward and upward!
